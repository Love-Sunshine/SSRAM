## A Segmentation-based Sequence Residual Attention Model for KRAS Gene Mutation Status Prediction in Colorectal Cancer
## 1.introduction
In this paper, we propose a Segmentation-based Sequence Residual Attention Model (SSRAM) to predict patients' KRAS gene mutation status with the segmentation task facilitating the classification task.
## 2.Requirement
